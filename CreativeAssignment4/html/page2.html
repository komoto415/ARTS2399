                    The blue jay scuffling in the bushes follows <br />
                    Some hidden purpose, and the gust of birds <br />
                    That spurts across the field, the wheeling swallows, <br />
                    Has nested in the trees and undergrowth. <br />
                    Seeking their instinct, or their poise, or both, <br />
                    One moves with an uncertain violence <br />
                    Under the dust thrown by a baffled sense <br />
                    Or the dull thunder of approximate words. <br />
                    <br />
                    On motorcycles, up the road, they come: <br />
                    Small, black, as flies hanging in heat, the Boys, <br />
                    Until the distance throws them forth, their hum <br />
                    Bulges to thunder held by calf and thigh. <br />
                    In goggles, donned impersonality, <br />
                    In gleaming jackets trophied with the dust, <br />
                    They strap in doubt – by hiding it, robust – <br />
                    And almost hear a meaning in their noise. <br />
                    <br />
                    Exact conclusion of their hardiness <br />
                    Has no shape yet, but from known whereabouts <br />
                    They ride, direction where the tyres press. <br />
                    They scare a flight of birds across the field: <br />
                    Much that is natural, to the will must yield. <br />
                    Men manufacture both machine and soul, <br />
                    And use what they imperfectly control <br />
                    To dare a future from the taken routes. <br />
                    <br />
                    It is a part solution, after all. <br />
                    One is not necessarily discord <br />
                    On earth; or damned because, half animal, <br />
                    One lacks direct instinct, because one wakes <br />
                    Afloat on movement that divides and breaks. <br />
                    One joins the movement in a valueless world, <br />
                    Choosing it, till, both hurler and the hurled, <br />
                    One moves as well, always toward, toward. <br />
                    <br />
                    A minute holds them, who have come to go: <br />
                    The self-defined, astride the created will <br />
                    They burst away; the towns they travel through <br />
                    Are home for neither bird nor holiness, <br />
                    For birds and saints complete their purposes. <br />
                    At worst, one is in motion; and at best, <br />
                    Reaching no absolute, in which to rest, <br />
                    One is always nearer by not keeping still.
