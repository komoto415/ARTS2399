                    Angels are unthinkable <br />
                    in hot weather <br />
                    <br />
                    except in some tropical locales, where <br />
                    from time to time, the women catch one in their nets, <br />
                    <br />
                    hang it dry, and fashion it into a lantern <br />
                    that will burn forever on its own inexhaustible oils. <br />
                    <br />
                    But here—shins smocked with heat rash, <br />
                    the supersaturated air. We no longer believe <br />
                    <br />
                    in energies pure enough not to carry heat, <br />
                    nor in connections—the thought of someone <br />
                    <br />
                    somewhere warming the air we breathe <br />
                    that one degree more . . . . <br />
    
                    In a packed pub during the World Cup final, <br />
                    a bony redhead woman gripped my arm <br />
                    <br />
                    too hard. <em>I could see how a bloke might fancy you.</em> <br />
                    Like a child’s perfect outline in fast-melting snow, <br />
                    <br />
                    her wet handprint on my skin, disappearing. <br />
                    The crowd boiling over, a steam jet: <em>Brrra-zil!</em> <br />
                    <br />
                    And Paris—a heroin addict <br />
                    who put her hypodermic <br />
                    <br />
                    to my throat: <em>Je suis malade. <br />
                        J’ai besoin de medicaments.</em> <br />
                    <br />
                    Grabbing her wrist, I saw <br />
                    her forearm’s tight net sleeve of drying blood. <br />
                    <br />
                    I don’t like to be touched. <br />
                    I stand in this mammoth parking lot, <br />
                    <br />
                    car doors open, letting the air conditioner <br />
                    run for a while before getting in. <br />
                    <br />
                    The heat presses down equally <br />
                    everywhere. It wants to focus itself, <br />
                    <br />
                    to vaporize something instantaneously, <br />
                    efficiently—that shopping cart, maybe, <br />
                    <br />
                    or that half-crushed brown-glass bottle— <br />
                    but can’t quite. Asphalt softens in the sun. <br />
                    <br />
                    Nothing’s detachable. <br />
                    The silvery zigzag line <br />
                    <br />
                    stitching the tarmac to the sky around the edges <br />
                    is no breeze, just a trick of heat. <br />
                    <br />
                    My splayed-out compact car half-sunk <br />
                    in the tar pit of its own shadow— <br />
                    <br />
                    strong-shouldered, straining <br />
                    to lift its vestigial wings.
