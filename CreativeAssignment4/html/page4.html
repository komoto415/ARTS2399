            <h3>Bath</h3>
            <h3>By AMY LOWELL</h3>

            <p class="poem-text">
                The day is fresh-washed and fair, and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air. <br />
                <br /> <br />
                The sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and
                <br />
                planes of greenish-white. It cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel, and cracks it to bright light.
                <br />
                <br />
                Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble
                <br />
                deliciously over the ceiling; a stir of my finger sets them whirring, reeling. I move a foot and the
                <br />
                planes of light in the water jar. I lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the sun-flawed
                <br />
                beryl water, flow over me. The day is almost too bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too
                <br />
                bright day. I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots. The sky is blue and high.
                <br />
                A crow flaps by the window, and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air.
