            <h1>1.</h1>
            <h3>Morningside Heights, July</h3>
            <h3>By WILLIAM MATTHEWS</h3>

            <p class="poem-text">
                Haze. Three student violists boarding <br />
                a bus. A clatter of jackhammers. <br />
                Granular light. A film of sweat for primer <br />
                and the heat for a coat of paint. <br />
                A man and a woman on a bench: <br />
                she tells him he must be psychic, <br />
                for how else could he sense, even before she knew, <br />
                that she’d need to call it off? A bicyclist <br />
                fumes by with a coach’s whistle clamped <br />
                hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle <br />
                on the boil. I never meant, she says. <br />
                But I thought, he replies. Two cabs almost <br />
                collide; someone yells fuck in Farsi. <br />
                I’m sorry, she says. The comforts <br />
                of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon. <br />
                The sky blurs—there’s a storm coming <br />
                up or down. A lank cat slinks liquidly <br />
                around a corner. How familiar <br />
                it feels to feel strange, hollower <br />
                than a bassoon. A rill of chill air <br />
                in the leaves. A car alarm. Hail.
            </p>
