Instructions
â€”

1. Open all the text files in the "content" folder in Atom. 
Each file you open should create a new tab in Atom.

2. Using Atom, create four new .html files and put them in the "html" folder:

    index.html
    page2.html
    page3.html
    page4.html

3. Place the text from the matthews.txt file into the index.html file.
   Place the text from the gunn.txt file into the page2.html file.
   Place the text from the youn.txt file into the page3.html file.
   Place the text from the lowell.txt file into the page4.html file.

4. Mark up the text in the four html files using the following conventions:

  use <h1> for poem numbers
  use <h3> for poem titles and authors
  use <p> for the text of the poems and the credits
  use <br /> to keep the line breaks in each poem
  (text)("link.html") means change the text in the () into a link and link to whatever is in (" ")
  *** means mark up the text between the *** with <em> and </em>

5. Test your HTML pages in a browser to make sure the links work and the poems keep their shape.
