                Mountains, museums, bridges and Central Park were just some of what he used to make astonishing and
                popular art with his wife and collaborator, Jeanne-Claude.

                        park’s pathways, passing underneath steel frames supporting free-hanging panels of saffron-colored

                Christo, the Bulgarian-born conceptual artist who turned to epic-scale environmental works in the late
                1960s, stringing a giant curtain across a mountain pass in Colorado, wrapping the Pont Neuf in Paris and
                the Reichstag in Berlin and zigzagging thousands of saffron-curtained gates throughout Central Park,
                died on Sunday at his home in New York City. He was 84.
            </p>
            <span>His death was announced on his official Facebook page. No cause was specified.</span>
            <p>
                Christo — he used only his first name — was an artistic Pied Piper. His grand projects, often decades in
                the making and all of them temporary, required the cooperation of dozens, sometimes hundreds, of
                landowners, government officials, judges, environmental groups, local residents, engineers and workers,
                many of whom had little interest in art and a deep reluctance to see their lives and their surroundings
                disrupted by an eccentric visionary speaking in only semi-comprehensible English.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again and again, Christo prevailed, through persistence, charm and a childlike belief that eventually
                everyone would see things the way he did.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The Gates,” Christo’s Central Park project, typified his approach. Like nearly all his projects, it
                began with a drawing, executed in 1979. Then came the seemingly eternal round of lobbying public
                officials, filing forms, waiting for environmental impact studies, speaking at hearings, rallying
                support. All of this, Christo insisted, was part of the art work.
