    <p>The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by the Italian artist <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. It is considered an archetypal
        masterpiece of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a> <a
            href="#cite_4">[4]<a> <a href="#cite_5">[5]</a>, and has been described as "the best known, the most
                visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world." <a
                    href="#cite_6">[6]</a> The painting's novel qualities include the subject's expression, which is
                frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms,
                and the atmospheric illusionism.</p>

    <p>The painting is likely of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in
        oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however,
        Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. Recent academic work suggests that it would not have
        been started before 1513. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French
        Republic itself, on permanent display at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre">Louvre
            Museum</a> in Paris since 1797.</p>

    <p>The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the
        highest known insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962 (equivalent to $650 million in 2018).</p>
